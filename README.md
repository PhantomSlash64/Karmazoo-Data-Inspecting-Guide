# Karmazoo Data Inspecting Guide
**Hello there explorers!** Willing to find some more secrets of the zoo (Or potentially make some mods)? Well you are in luck! Because this repo will document all the tools we can use to find new secrets of the game KarmaZoo, I thought I would share my technical knowledge since the game is dead and this guide will prove useful. All downloads to the tools will be linked alongside their names.

# DISCLAIMER!!!
If you do decide to mod the game (Any tool that has this at the beginning: !) There is a chance that you might be banned if you use it maliciously so DO NOT USE IT TO CHEAT OR MAKE ANY GAME UNFAIR! For mods you wanna try, Ether try the text/sound replacement mods offline via the Couch mode or in a private server that may come in the future

## [DragonUnPACKer](https://github.com/elbereth/DragonUnPACKer)
The images in the game's install directory are unencrypted and can be easily accessible via opening the file below with the HyperRipper function
>KarmaZoo\resources\cookedData\bigfile.bfdata
Fun fact: EVERYTHING that was in the KarmaPass could've all been leaked because ***EVERY IMAGE UP TO THE LAST ONE WAS IN THE bigfile.bfdata*** But thankfully I was nice not to release everything that was not encrypted so you are welcome :) ~~Seriously though how was that not noticed day one?~~
Also I might do some sprite sheets of the game so stay tuned!

## ! [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
This tool lets you see the Text/Dialogue in the game including game directories as well as functions. It is possible to edit the game text but unfortunately the game has to be in the same size.

However this is an old screenshot of the mod and yes, I did make this text edit and no, it's not photoshopped. This is really modded in the game.
This can also be used to find the last remaining secrets.

## [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
 This lets you listen to the game's Narrator clips and the sounds of everygame including the game's music
***You need to install [this component](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_input_vgmstream) to the program to listen to the game's FSB Files!***

## ! [Fmod Bank Tools](https://gamebanana.com/tools/13847)
Incase you want to potentially make any sound mods, This is for you! You can figure it out easily if you know where to look online but this should be familiar to people who have modded Pizza Tower or any game that used FSB bank files

# That is all the tools I have! Good luck on your journey to find all the secrets of the zoo!
